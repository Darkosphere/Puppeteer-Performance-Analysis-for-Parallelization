# Puppeteer-Performance-Analysis-for-Parallelization
This repo will provide some scripts in order to compare **Puppeteer** performance when using a _single **Browser** instance and multiples **Pages**_ or _multiples **Browser** instances with a single **Page** each_ in parallelized setups. Along with some results from the performed tests.


**Dependencies:** 
- <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-core">puppeteer-core</a>
- <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjs">mathjs</a> (used for rounding `float` values during test result transformation)

If you have not installed those modules yet you can do it with:
<pre>npm i puppeteer-core
npm i mathjs</pre>
