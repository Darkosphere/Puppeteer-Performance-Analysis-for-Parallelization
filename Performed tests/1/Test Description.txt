Description of test #1: 
This test compare the following two approachs "Single Browser Multiples Pages" or "Multiples Browsers Single Page",
by running both in a loop (one execution at a time) that will go through the defined concurrency plage. 

Measured values on each test are the initialization time, all pages loading times (will be stored in an aray) and the closing time. 
Those measurements of performance are placed in order to ignore some delays that have been added to avoid error during the test.
So basically each method returns this array: [initTime<float>, loadingTimes[float, ...], closingTime<float>].

Prior to the log of tests results in a file, this returned array will be turned into the following object:
o = { 
  type: 'string', // 'Single Browser > Multiple Tabs' || 'Multi Browsers > Single Tab'
  parallelization: int,
  initTime: float, // ms
  loadingTimes: [float, ...], // ms
  closingTime: float; // ms
}


Tested Concurrency plage: 2-20
Amount of pages loadings by test: 2000
url used to perform the test: 'https://www.google.com/'

Description of the task to be runned concurrently on all Pages:
We go to the specified url waiting for 'networkidle0' and measure that loading time,
after that we wait 2s (to reduce spam) before resolving with the loading time of the page.
